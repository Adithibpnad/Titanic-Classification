This is my Bharat Intern DataScience internship project.
This project encompasses a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, involving data exploration, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning preparation. Initial steps include checking dataset characteristics, handling missing values, and visualizing key features such as gender, class, and age distribution. The project delves into statistical insights, showcasing correlations and distributions through various plots. In preparation for machine learning, categorical variables are encoded, relevant features selected, and the dataset split into training and testing sets. The overarching goal is to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, making this project an exploration of both descriptive and predictive analytics within the context of a classic dataset.
